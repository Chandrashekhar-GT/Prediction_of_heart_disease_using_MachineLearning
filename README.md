# Prediction of Heart Disease using Machine Learning
# Project Overview
In this project, I used machine learning algorithms to predict the presence of heart disease in patients. The goal of this project was to create a model that could accurately predict the likelihood of a patient having heart disease based on a set of input features.

# Data Collection
The data used in this project was sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The specific dataset used was the Heart Disease dataset. This dataset contains data on patient characteristics, such as age, sex, and medical history, as well as the presence or absence of heart disease.

# Data Cleaning and EDA
Before building the machine learning model, I performed data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the dataset. This involved removing any missing values, checking for outliers, and visualizing the distribution of the input features.

# Machine Learning Model
After cleaning the data and performing EDA, I built a machine learning model to predict the presence of heart disease. I used various algorithms such as logistic regression, KNN, Decision tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting. I evaluated the performance of each model and selected the best-performing model based on accuracy and other evaluation metrics.

# Model Deployment
To make the model easily accessible to users, I deployed it using Streamlit. Users can now input their own patient characteristics and receive a prediction on the likelihood of them having heart disease.

# Conclusion
This project demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning algorithms in predicting the presence of heart disease. The deployed model can be a useful tool for healthcare professionals in identifying patients who are at risk of developing heart disease.
